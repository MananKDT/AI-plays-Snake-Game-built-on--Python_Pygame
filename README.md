# Snake-Game-using-Python_Pygame
    Use python 3.5+
    and install pygame through : pip install pygame
   Futher Plans-
1. Using tflearn to train neural network so that our snake can play game by its own.
2. Adding new stages.
3. Adding levels(difficulty).

Please let me know in comments for any issues and things we can add.
