# AI-plays-Snake-Game-built-on-Python_Pygame
    Use python3 (3.5+)
    and install pygame through : pip install pygame
    
Provided code will run the game based on user interaction.
To train the machine:-
1. Uncomment from line 8-11 and from line 267-273.
2. Comment the line 266

   Futher Plans-
1. Using tflearn to train neural network so that our snake can play game by its own(done).
2. Adding new stages.
3. Adding levels(difficulty).

Please let me know in comments for any issues and things we can add.
